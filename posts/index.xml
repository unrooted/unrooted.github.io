&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NUG&lt;/strong&gt; is a Nix User Group. I&amp;rsquo;ve founded Polish one around 3 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-is-all-of-this-fuss-about"&gt;What is all of this fuss about?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the founding of &lt;strong&gt;Polish NUG&lt;/strong&gt;, we&amp;rsquo;ve held two meetups, in April of 2024 as well as in May of 2025.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to publish the recordings from both of them a while ago on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to give back to the community, at least by hosting such meetings.
Hence, I personally think it&amp;rsquo;s great to share recordings with those, who were unable to attend either of those, or gained interest in Nix only recently.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
