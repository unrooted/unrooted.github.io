## What is a NUG?
**NUG** is a Nix User Group. I've founded Polish one around 3 years ago. 

### What is all of this fuss about? 

Since the founding of **Polish NUG**, we've held two meetups, in April of 2024 as well as in May of 2025. 
I've been able to publish the recordings from both of them a while ago on YouTube. 

It's important to give back to the community, at least by hosting such meetings.
Hence, I personally think it's great to share recordings with those, who were unable to attend either of those, or gained interest in Nix only recently. 

You can find both of them embedded below:

> note: sorry that the audio is off in the 2025 edition, however, we've experienced some recording issues
